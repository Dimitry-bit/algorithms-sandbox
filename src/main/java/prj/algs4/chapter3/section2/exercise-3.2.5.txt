3.2.5 Suppose that we have an estimate ahead of time of how often search keys are
to be accessed in a BST, and the freedom to insert them in any order that we desire.
Should the keys be inserted into the tree in increasing order, decreasing order of likely
frequency of access, or some other order? Explain your answer.

Neither inserting the keys in increasing or decreasing order of likely frequency of access will be the optimal approach.
