2.4.11 Suppose that your application will have a huge number of insert operations, but
only a few remove the maximum operations. Which priority-queue implementation do
you think would be most effective: heap, unordered array, or ordered array?

The most effective implementation would be an unordered array, because insertions are constant time, while it's O(log n) for heap, and O(N) for ordered arrays.
