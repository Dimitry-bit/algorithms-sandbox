2.4.14 What is the minimum number of items that must be exchanged during a re-
move the maximum operation in a heap of size N with no duplicate keys? Give a heap
of size 15 for which the minimum is achieved. Answer the same questions for two and
three successive remove the maximum operations.

1) The minimum number of exchanges is 1, and one exchange will involve 2 items.

    3
   / \
  1   2

2) It gets more complicated when the heap is of size 15. For 'n > 3' you will need to swaps '84, 100', '99, 84', 
   that's 2 swaps each involving 2 items, so in total 4 items.

                 100
         /                   \
        99                   90
     /     \              /      \
    9       8            89      88
   / \     / \          /  \    /  \
  7   6   5   4        87  86  85  84
