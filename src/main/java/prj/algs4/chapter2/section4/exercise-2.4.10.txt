2.4.10 Suppose that we wish to avoid wasting one position in a heap-ordered array
pq[], putting the largest value in pq[0], its children in pq[1] and pq[2], and so forth,
proceeding in level order. Where are the parents and children of pq[k]?

Parent index = (k - 1) / 2
Children indices:
  Left  = 2k + 1
  Right = 2k + 2
