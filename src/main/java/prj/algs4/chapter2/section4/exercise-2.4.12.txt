2.4.12 Suppose that your application will have a huge number of find the maximum
operations, but a relatively small number of insert and remove the maximum operations.
Which priority-queue implementation do you think would be most effective: heap,
unordered array, or ordered array?

The most effective implementation would be ordered array, because find the maximum is a constant time operation, while it's O(log n) for heap,
and O(N) for unordered arrays
