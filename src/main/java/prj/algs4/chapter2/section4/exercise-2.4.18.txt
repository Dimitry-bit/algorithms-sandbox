2.4.18 In MaxPQ, suppose that a client calls insert() with an item that is larger than
all items in the queue, and then immediately calls delMax(). Assume that there are
no duplicate keys. Is the resulting heap identical to the heap as it was before these operations? 
Answer the same question for two insert() operations (the first with a key
larger than all keys in the queue and the second for a key larger than that one) followed
by two delMax() operations.


1)

Initial state:

        4
       / \
      3   2
     /
    1

insert(5)

        5
       / \
      4   2
     / \
    1   3 

delMax()

        4
       / \
      3   2
     /
    1

The resulting heap is identical to to the initial state.

2)

Initial state:

        4
       / \
      3   2
     /
    1

insert(5)

        5
       / \
      4   2
     / \
    1   3 

insert(6)

       6
     /   \
    4     5
   / \   /
  1   3 2

delMax()

       5
     /   \
    4     2
   / \
  1   3

delMax()

       4
      / \
     3   2
    /
   1
