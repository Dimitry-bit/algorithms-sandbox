# 2.3.4

Suppose that the initial random shuffle is omitted. Give six arrays of ten elements
for which Quick.sort() uses the worst-case number of compares.

1) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
2) [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]
3) [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]
4) [10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
5) [11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2]
6) [12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3]
