/* 2.1.6 Which method runs faster for an array with all keys identical, selection sort or
insertion sort? */

Insertion sort will be faster, because it only makes one comparison with the previous element and won't exchange
any elements, running in linear time. Selection sort will exchange each element with itself and will run in quadratic time.
