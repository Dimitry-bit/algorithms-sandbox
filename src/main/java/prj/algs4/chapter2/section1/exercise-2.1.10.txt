/* 2.1.10 Why not use selection sort for h-sorting in shellsort? */

1) Insertion sort is faster than selection sort because as "h" decreases, the array becomes partially sorted.
2) Insertion sort makes less comparisons in partially sorted arrays than selection sort.
3) When h-sorting, eventually h will have an increment value of 1, so using a selection sort with an increment value
    of 1 would be same as using the standard selection sort algorithm from the beginning. This would make the steps with
    the previous increments unnecessary work.
